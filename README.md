# odin-landing-page
My first landing page project from The Odin Project Foundations course. Built with HTML and CSS, focusing on basic layout, and clean structure. The goal of this project is to practice building a fully structured webpage from scratch using semantic HTML and CSS.

To complete this project, I learned and applied skills such as:
- Writing semantic HTML for a clean and accessible structure
- Styling with CSS, including flexbox for layout and basic design (non-responsive for now)
- Organizing files and assets for a professional project structure
- Using Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration

My next Steps: 
- Add full mobile responsiveness for different screen sizes
- Improve accessibility with ARIA roles and better color contrast
- Experiment with CSS animations and transitions for interactivity
- Refactor code for cleaner, more maintainable CSS
- Eventually add JavaScript for dynamic elements (e.g., interactive buttons or forms). 

This project marks my first step toward mastering front-end development and building a strong foundation for future projects.
